# Good PowerShell Practices 

- A Good way to learn PowerShell is to automate **Cloud Resources** and Docker 
  - Create/ssh-connect Windows 
  - Create/ssh-connect Linux 
  - Automate everything you can.

- Start using PowerShell cross-platform and leave "Windows powershell" 

- Learn PowerShell on Linux and Windows at the same time
- save your powershell scripts in git and share with public users

- Never store secrets in scripts !
- Never store keys in scripts !

- Do Not repeat Yourself (DRY)
  - use Variables
  - use Functions
  - use [$profile optimization](https://github.com/Jalalhejazi/powershell-profile.git)
  - Happy Automation
